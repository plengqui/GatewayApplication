# tmsi
Parser and management application for a Tinymesh radio network.
Listens to a serial COM port on the local PC where you have connected a Tinymesh gateway in packet mode.

## Usage
    C:\Temp> python comwrapper port=COM1 baudrate=9600
    C:\Temp> python tmsi_gui

## Sourcedoce and files documentation
The python code is documented using docstrings.

### comwrapper.py
A python script that should _allways_ be running when the Tinymesh network is active. It listens to incoming packets on the serial port (where your Tinymesh Gateway should be connected) and writes the packets to a store-and-forward queue, which is later read by the TinymeshController.

### tmsi_gui.py
A python script that runs the GUI part of the application. Invokes TinymeshController regularly and displays the health of radios, and shows any received Sportident punches.

### tmcontroller.py
Defines the class TinymeshController which checks for new Tinymesh packets on the store-and-forward queue, parses them, and updates a record of health and connectivity status for each radio unit. If a received packet contains a Sportident punch, parse it and log the punch. TODO: send it to competition administration system using SIRAP. TinymeshController is a singleton that we call often from the event loop in the GUI.

### siparser.py
Defines SiPacket. Parse a byte string generated by a Sportident station when a runner punches there.

### tmparser.py
Defines parsing of all different kinds of Tinymesh radio packets.
