# tmsi
Parser and management application for a Tinymesh radio network.
Listens to a com port where you have connected a Tinymesh gateway in packet mode.

## Usage
>>> python comwrapper port=COM1 baudrate=9600
>>> python tmsi_gui


## Sourcedoce and files documentation
The python code is documented using docstrings.

### tmsi_gui.py
A python script that runs the application. Invokes TinymeshController regularly and displays the health of radios

### tmcontroller.py
Defines the class TinymeshController which checks for new Tinymesh packets on the store-and-forward queue, parses them, and updates a record of health and connectivity status for each radio unit. If a received packet contains a Sportident punch, parse it and log the punch. TODO: send it to competition administration system using SIRAP. TinymeshController is a singleton that we call often from the event loop in the GUI.

### siparser.py
Defines SiPacket. Parse a byte string generated by a Sportident station when a runner punches there.

### tmparser.py
Defines parsing of all different kinds of Tinymesh radio packets.

### comwrapper.py
A python script that should _allways_ be running. It listens to incoming packets on the serial port (where your Tinymesh Gateway should be connected) and writes the packets to a store-and-forward queue, which is later read by the TinymeshController.
